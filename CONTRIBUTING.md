## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Git
- Basic understanding of React
- Mathematical knowledge (for math-related contributions)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mathmaster.git
   cd mathmaster
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Code Style Guidelines

#### **React Components**
```jsx
// Use functional components with hooks
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
  
  return (
    <div className="tailwind-classes">
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **Math Solvers**
```javascript
// Follow this pattern for new solvers
export function solveTopic(expression) {
  try {
    // Parse and validate input
    const parsedExpression = parseExpression(expression);
    
    // Solve step by step
    const steps = generateSteps(parsedExpression);
    const answer = calculateAnswer(parsedExpression);
    
    // Generate educational content
    const tips = generateTips(expression);
    const commonMistakes = generateMistakes(expression);
    
    return {
      steps,
      answer,
      tips,
      common_mistakes: commonMistakes,
      graph: generateGraph(expression) // if applicable
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return fallbackResponse(expression, error);
  }
}
```

#### **File Naming**
- Components: `PascalCase.jsx`
- Utilities: `camelCase.js`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
